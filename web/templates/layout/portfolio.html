                        <h4>Bellbank page</h4>
                        <p>One of the projects that helped me improve in the design of web systems, was the creation of this web page.</p>
                        <p>I remember that when we designed it, we took as a guide the new google patros (material desing), this gave the bank a more updated and innovative view. In collaboration with the project manager we made that design approve.</p>
                        <p>It was a very busy time on launch day.</p>

                        <h4>Single Page Generator</h4>
                        <p>Once the need arose to create a website to launch a product, it needed to be something simple and with the style of the product, I was told the idea (I knew other products that were about to come out) and it occurred to me the idea of creating a generator of product templates.</p>
                        <p>My supervisor agreed with the idea, delayed the launch of the product a few days to create a prototype and with this draw a template.</p>
                        <p>Then came the time to draw several products almost in parallel and it was super simple to create a template for each product.</p>
